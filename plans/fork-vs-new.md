Fork vs. New Repository: Concerns When Migrating an Archived Project
====================================================================
When continuing a sunset/archived open-source project under a new organization, you have two options for migrating repositories: **(1) keep them as formal GitHub forks of the original,** or **(2) create fresh repositories and push the original history** (making them independent). Both approaches _technically_ preserve commit history, but they differ in GitHub’s handling. Below we outline the key concerns with leaving the repos as forks versus using new standalone repos:
Keeping the New Repositories as Forks (Forked from Original)
------------------------------------------------------------
Using GitHub’s fork mechanism links your new repo to the original. This has the benefit of automatically showing it was “forked from \[Original\]” (giving credit and possibly helping discovery via the original’s fork list[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/15on8mk/forking_archived_projects_vs_copying_the_code/#:~:text=You%20can%20get%20discovered%20if,project%27s%20forks%2C%20which%20is%20nice)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/15on8mk/forking_archived_projects_vs_copying_the_code/#:~:text=abotelho)), but it introduces several concerns:
*   **Pull Requests Default to Upstream:** By design, any pull request from a fork will target the original “upstream” repository as the base, not your fork, **and this default cannot be changed**[github.com](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/11729#:~:text=). In your case the upstream is archived (read-only), but GitHub’s interface and CLI will still assume PRs should go there. This can confuse contributors and lead to misdirected PRs. For example, one developer described that forgetting to change the base meant opening PRs against the upstream by mistake, which notified the wrong maintainers – they had to close those PRs and recreate them on the fork[github.com](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/11729#:~:text=The%20issue%20with%20the%20default,create%20it%20locally). In short, leaving the repo as a fork means you’ll constantly need to remind contributors to retarget pull requests to your fork (the new “upstream” in spirit, but not in GitHub’s eyes).
*   **“Forever” Fork Link (Detaching Requires Effort):** Once a repo is a fork on GitHub, it remains tied to the original project’s network. There is no one-click way to make it independent. You would need to **contact GitHub support or manually recreate the repository** to detach it[docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/detaching-a-fork#:~:text=To%20turn%20your%20fork%20into,connection%20to%20the%20original%20network). The official process to “leave” a fork network involves deleting the fork and re-pushing it as a new repo[docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/detaching-a-fork#:~:text=To%20turn%20your%20fork%20into,connection%20to%20the%20original%20network)[docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/detaching-a-fork#:~:text=Deleting%20a%20fork%20will%20permanently,This%20action%20cannot%20be%20undone). In other words, the fork status is permanent unless you take those manual steps.
*   **Contributors Already Forked Original:** GitHub only allows one fork of a given repository per user account. If someone already forked the original repo in the past, they **cannot fork your new repo** (since it’s considered the same network) without deleting or renaming their old fork[github.com](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23839#:~:text=I%E2%80%99m%20afraid%20you%20can%20only,the%20upstream%20of%20your%20repository). This could hinder contributors who have existing forks of the archived project – they’d have to either contribute via their old fork or remove it to fork yours. Using a forked repo thus adds friction for any contributor who was already in the original project’s fork network.
*   **Issues and Settings:** When a repository is archived, issues and other interactive features are disabled. A fork _inherits_ the code but not the settings – you would have to explicitly re-enable things like the issue tracker or GitHub Actions on your fork. (It’s possible to do so in the fork’s settings[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/15on8mk/forking_archived_projects_vs_copying_the_code/#:~:text=Fork%20the%20repository%20then%20in,on%20issues%20in%20repository%20settings), but it’s an extra step.) This is a minor concern, but worth noting so you’re not caught off guard expecting issues or actions to work immediately on the fork.
*   **Contributor Graph and Stats:** Contributions to forked repositories are not counted on GitHub profiles the same way as contributions to independent repos. GitHub doesn’t show commits in a fork on your contribution graph **unless those commits get merged into the parent’s default branch**[github.com](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/136306#:~:text=Merge%20your%20contributions%20into%20the,merged%20into%20the%20main%20branch). In an active fork that will never be merged upstream (because upstream is archived), contributors might not get “credit” on their profiles for pull requests/commits made on your fork. This can demotivate some contributors since their work won’t display in the green contribution squares. (One open-source guide explicitly notes that if a project is abandoned, _“there’s no need to fork it”_ on GitHub, because your contributions won’t be measured on the platform when working on a fork[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=If%20you%20find%20an%20inactive,have%20full%20ownership%20of%20it).)
*   **Discoverability and Search:** Forked repositories are somewhat hidden in GitHub’s search and discovery mechanisms. Notably, **GitHub’s code search excludes forks by default** (to avoid duplicate results), unless the fork surpasses the original in popularity[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=,stars%20than%20the%20original%20project)[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=). This means your new forked project might not show up in search results or GitHub’s explore/trending pages as readily as a standalone project would. Only if your fork gains more stars than the original would it be treated as the “main” project for search purposes[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=,stars%20than%20the%20original%20project). If discoverability is a concern, this is a significant drawback. (On the flip side, being a fork means anyone visiting the original can see your fork in the network list, which might funnel some interested users your way. But this is a passive form of discovery compared to normal search visibility.)
In summary, keeping the repos as official forks carries **several workflow and visibility drawbacks** in your scenario. It can still work – especially if you value the link to the original project – but you’d need to manage these issues (e.g. documenting that contributors should fork _your_ repo and change PR bases, possibly requesting GitHub to detach later, etc.).
Creating New Independent Repositories (Pushing History to a New Repo)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The alternative is to **create brand-new repositories** in your organization and push the original project’s commit history and tags to them (essentially what GitHub’s documentation calls “manually leaving the fork network”[docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/detaching-a-fork#:~:text=To%20turn%20your%20fork%20into,connection%20to%20the%20original%20network)). This approach treats your version as a wholly independent project (even though it’s a code fork in the open-source sense). Key considerations for this route:
*   **Correct PR Targets by Default:** Since the new repos won’t be marked as forks, they are their own upstream. When contributors fork _your_ repo or push branches, pull requests will naturally target your repository. There’s no “ghost upstream” in GitHub’s interface, eliminating the risk of PRs accidentally going to the archived project. This makes contributing more straightforward (especially for new contributors who might not realize the base needs to be changed in a forked setup).
*   **No Unwanted Upstream Remote:** Cloning an independent repo via GitHub CLI or git yields just one remote (`origin` pointing to your repo). It won’t auto-configure an `upstream` remote as it does when cloning a fork. This prevents any confusion that could arise from developers inadvertently pushing or trying to sync with the original repo. Essentially, your new repo behaves like a first-class origin from the start.
*   **Contributors Can Fork Freely:** Anyone can fork your repository without conflict. Even if they had a fork of the original project, that doesn’t matter now because your repo is not in the same network. This removes the weird one-fork-per-user limitation. Developers who worked off their own fork of the archived repo can simply add your repo as a new remote or fork yours anew – whichever they prefer – to begin contributing to the revived project.
*   **Full Credit for Contributions:** Commits and pull requests on a normal (non-fork) repository will count toward contributors’ profiles as usual. All the activity in your new repo will be attributed to it directly. This is often highlighted as a reason to start a fresh repo for an abandoned project: _contributors get proper recognition_. The open-source Q&A community recommends creating a new project for an abandoned repo partly for this reason, since _“by ‘forking’, you give people the impression you’ll push back to the original project”_ and your contributions may not show up on GitHub[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=If%20you%20find%20an%20inactive,have%20full%20ownership%20of%20it). By owning a new repo, you **establish a new “upstream”** where all contribution stats, project insights, and so on accrue to your organization.
*   **Search Visibility:** Your project will be indexed like any other repository. Anyone searching on GitHub by topics, keywords, or code snippets is more likely to see results from your repository (because it isn’t hidden as a fork). This can help newcomers discover that **your repo is the active maintained version**. You won’t have to out-star the original just to appear in search results – your repo is separate and thus searchable from the start[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=).
*   **Fork Link & Attribution:** The obvious downside of not using GitHub’s fork feature is that you lose the automatic visual connection to the original project on the platform. Your repo will not say “forked from \_\_\_”, and it won’t show up in the original repository’s fork network list. For transparency and credit, you should manually acknowledge the original project (for example, in your README or description, explain that your project is a continuation of the archived project, and perhaps link to it). This is usually sufficient, especially if the license requires credit – the commit history also remains intact, carrying original authorship information. In practice, this is a minor issue and can be addressed by documentation. Most importantly, it avoids giving the false impression that you intend to contribute changes back to the original (which you don’t, since it’s archived)[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=If%20you%20find%20an%20inactive,have%20full%20ownership%20of%20it).
*   **Upstream Pull Requests (not needed):** Since the original maintainers have archived the project, you’ve stated there’s no intention of upstreaming any changes. Thus, one of the main reasons to use a fork – easy GitHub PRs to the original – is moot. If circumstances ever changed and upstream became active, you _could_ still contribute by other means (patch files or pushing to a temporary fork), but this is purely hypothetical. Given the original is sunset, maintaining an official fork provides little to no practical benefit in terms of collaboration with them[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=You%20should%20)[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=You%20should%20create%20a%20new,project%20when).
*   **Initial Overhead vs. Long-term Maintenance:** Creating a new repo and pushing the history is a one-time setup cost (which can be scripted). Beyond that, maintenance is simpler because you won’t be wrestling with GitHub’s fork-specific quirks. In contrast, keeping a fork might seem easier initially (since GitHub’s fork button copies everything for you), but it carries ongoing maintenance quirks (needing to manage upstream remotes, instructing contributors, possibly detaching later, etc.). Many maintainers who revive dormant projects choose the clean break for this reason.
Conclusion
----------
In a case where the original project is **abandoned/archived**, the consensus is that it’s usually better to **migrate to a new independent repository** rather than an official GitHub fork. As multiple experts note, if you’re not submitting changes back to the original, _“there’s no need to ‘fork’ it”_ on GitHub[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=If%20you%20find%20an%20inactive,have%20full%20ownership%20of%20it). The fork link might look nice and offer some visibility among existing users, but it comes with downsides: pull requests defaulting to the wrong place[github.com](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/11729#:~:text=), difficulty for contributors (especially those who already have forks)[github.com](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23839#:~:text=I%E2%80%99m%20afraid%20you%20can%20only,the%20upstream%20of%20your%20repository), and hidden contributions/search results[github.com](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/136306#:~:text=Merge%20your%20contributions%20into%20the,merged%20into%20the%20main%20branch)[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=,stars%20than%20the%20original%20project).
By creating new repositories for your organization and pushing the entire commit history (and tags), you effectively **preserve everything except the GitHub-specific fork relationship**. Your new repos become the “true upstream” going forward – which is exactly what you want for a actively maintained continuation. Contributors will instinctively treat your repos as canonical, and GitHub will too, without the shadow of the original repository affecting workflows.
That said, if you decide to **keep the fork link** (for attribution or continuity), be mindful of the mentioned concerns. You might consider adding contributor guidelines to always open PRs on your repo (and how to set the base properly), enabling issues on the fork, and perhaps eventually asking GitHub Support to **“defork”** the repository once it has diverged significantly. But given that you don’t mind whether the new org’s repos appear independent or not, the **safer path is to use brand-new repositories** for a clean start. This aligns with open-source best practices for abandoned projects and will ensure your revived project can grow without inherited limitations from the archived repo’s GitHub settings and network[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=If%20you%20find%20an%20inactive,have%20full%20ownership%20of%20it)[opensource.stackexchange.com](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1934/rules-guidelines-about-forking-a-project-vs-creating-a-new-one#:~:text=You%20should%20create%20a%20new,project%20when).
