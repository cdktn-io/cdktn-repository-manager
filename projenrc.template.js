  // 20.16.0 floor while Node 20 was in maintenance). Per nodejs/Release:
  //   v20 EOL 2026-04-30 (dead)  v22 maintenance until 2027-04-30  v24 active LTS
  // so 22.11.0 today. Also matches @cdktn/provider-project's own engines.
  //
  // Verified empirically on Node 22.22.3 against @cdktn/provider-null: cdktn App +
  // NullProvider + Resource synthesizes correctly, so a 24 floor was simply untrue.

  // depend on the Node version CI builds it with.

  // with pacmak, they never run the published bindings in a consumer app, so
